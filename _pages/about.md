Praharsha Publications was founded in October 2021 by a group of literature enthusiasts with a combined experience of more than thirty years in publishing. Our focus is bringing out high quality content presented in a readable and charming form. When we produce a book, we pay special attention to every detail but when we set a price for it, we make it as affordable as possible for the reader.
